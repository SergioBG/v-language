#summary V usage

= Introduction =

V language is a simple concatenative language inspired by joy. Currently it
exists in JVM land only.

= Usage =
(Notice that the prompt is '|')
 * invocation
{{{
   java v/V
      |V|
   |
}}}
 * Simple arithmetic
{{{
   |1 2 +
   =3
}}}

 * Define words using the function '.'
{{{
   |[add +].
   |1 1 add
   =2
   |[check [10 >?] ['is gt 10' println] ['is lt 10' println] ifte].

   |1 check
   =is lt 10
   |100 check
   =is gt 10
}}}

  * how qsort would look like when the primitives are available
{{{
   |[qsort
      [small]
      []
      [uncons [>?] split]
      [[swap] dip cons concat]
      binrec].

   |[1 3 2 8] qsort
   |?
   =1 2 3 8
}}}
Notice the similarity between this and the joy version [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language) here].
